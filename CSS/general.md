> This site teaches the CSS fundamentals that are used in any website's layout.

- [learn css layout - the pedantic way](http://book.mixu.net/css/)
> CSS, like the Matrix, is a system based on rules.
>
> I wrote this set of chapters to describe those rules. It's long-form writing, but not book-length. I don't think I'd want to write a full book about CSS, but writing about CSS layout has been useful.

- Opinion: [Control Your Type: Google Fonts + Chrome = trouble?](https://m.signalvnoise.com/control-your-type-google-fonts-chrome-trouble-c21e1a106436#.4i827a73f)
> Author received some bug reports about their new google fonts, and turns out these problems were caused by local fonts(local('..')). So he suggests that avoid using local(), use remote source host by your own instead.
> However, I do not agree with it. = = I think local() is nice approach (also has a better performance) and these problems should be solved by properly settings on user's computer.
