# English Quotes / Notes

It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.

It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.

The new luxury is to shed the shackles of deferred living -- to pursue your passion now, while you are still working.

Your life no longer needs to divided into arbitrary phrases of work and retirement.

You don't need to be extraordinarily lucky or hand working to make your work life fit with your passions -- if you're free to pick where to work and when to work.

The new luxury is the luxury of freedom and time.
