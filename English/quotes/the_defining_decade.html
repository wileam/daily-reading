<p>We think that by avoiding decisions now, we keep all of our options open for later&#x2014;but not making choices is a choice all the same.</p>
<p>I urge twentysomethings to reclaim their twenties, their status as adults, and their futures.</p>
<p>I want to persuade you that thirty is not the new twenty precisely because we settle down later than we used to. What this has done is made the twenties not an irrelevant downtime but a developmental sweet spot that comes only once.</p>
<p>The twenties are that critical period of adulthood. These are the years when it will be easiest to start the lives we want. And no matter what we do, the twenties are an inflection point&#x2014;the great reorganization&#x2014;a time when the experiences we have disproportionately influence the adult lives we will lead.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine likes to say that twentysomethings are like airplanes, planes just leaving New York City bound for somewhere west. Right after takeoff, a slight change in course is the difference between landing in either Seattle or San Diego. But once a plane is nearly in San Diego, only a big detour will redirect it to the northwest. Likewise, in the twentysomething years, even a small shift can radically change where we end up in our thirties and beyond. The twenties are an up-in-the-air and turbulent time, but if we can figure out how to navigate, even a little bit at a time, we can get further, faster, than at any other stage in life. It is a pivotal time when the things we do&#x2014;and the things we don&#x2019;t do&#x2014;will have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come. So let&#x2019;s get going. The time is now.</p>
<p>He spent his teens and twenties in search of himself.</p>
<p>He felt that a true and authentic identity should not be rushed and, to that end, he advocated for a period of delay when youth could safely explore without real risk or obligation. For some, this period was college. For others, such as Erikson, it was a personal walkabout or Wanderschaft. Either way, he stressed the importance of coming into one&#x2019;s own. Erikson thought everyone should create his or her own life.</p>
<p>Identity capital is our collection of personal assets. It is the repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time. These are the investments we make in ourselves, the things we do well enough, or long enough, that they become a part of who we are. Some identity capital goes on a r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;, such as degrees, jobs, test scores, and clubs. Other identity capital is more personal, such as how we speak, where we are from, how we solve problems, how we look. Identity capital is how we build ourselves&#x2014;bit by bit, over time. Most important, identity capital is what we bring to the adult marketplace. It is the currency we use to metaphorically purchase jobs and relationships and other things we want.</p>
<p>The only way to figure out what to do is to do&#x2014;something.</p>
<p>Yes is how you get your first job, and your next job, and your spouse, and even your kids. Even if it&#x2019;s a bit edgy, a bit out of your comfort zone, saying yes means you will do something new, meet someone new, and make a difference. </p>
<p>&#x2014;Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google</p>
<p>Most twentysomethings yearn for a feeling of community, and they cling to their strong ties to feel more connected. Ironically, being enmeshed with a group can actually enhance feelings of alienation, because we&#x2014;and our tribe&#x2014;become insular and detached. Over time, our initial feeling of being part of a group becomes a sense of disconnection with the larger world.</p>
<p>The more we know about the way things work, the more we feel a part of things.</p>
<p>The Ben Franklin effect shows that, while attitudes influence behavior, behavior can also shape attitudes.</p>
<p>I would advise the same approach today as you ask your own weak ties for letters of recommendation, suggestions or introductions, or well-planned informational interviews: Make yourself interesting. Make yourself relevant. Do your homework so you know precisely what you want or need. Then, respectfully, ask for it. Some weak ties will say no. More than you think will say yes.</p>
<p>Uncertainty will always be part of the taking-charge process. 
&#x2014;Harold Geneen, businessman
The search of youth is not for all-permissibility, but rather for new ways of directly facing up to what truly counts. 
&#x2014;Erik Erikson, psychoanalyst</p>
<p>Ian told me his twentysomething years were like being in the middle of the ocean, like this vast, unmarked body of water. He couldn&#x2019;t see land in any direction, so he didn&#x2019;t know which way to go. He felt overwhelmed by the prospect that he could swim anywhere or do anything. He was equally paralyzed by the fact that he didn&#x2019;t know which of the anythings would work out. Tired and hopeless at age twenty-five, he said he was treading water to stay alive.</p>
<p>There is a certain terror that goes along with saying &#x201C;My life is up to me.&#x201D; It is scary to realize there&#x2019;s no magic, you can&#x2019;t just wait around, no one can really rescue you, and you have to do something. Not knowing what you want to do with your life&#x2014;or not at least having some ideas about what to do next&#x2014;is a defense against that terror. It is a resistance to admitting that the possibilities are not endless. It is a way of pretending that now doesn&#x2019;t matter. Being confused about choices is nothing more than hoping that maybe there is a way to get through life without taking charge.</p>
<p>Unthought knowns are those things we know about ourselves but forget somehow. These are the dreams we have lost sight of or the truths we sense but don&#x2019;t say out loud. We may be afraid of acknowledging the unthought known to other people because we are afraid of what they might think. Even more often, we fear what the unthought known will then mean for ourselves and our lives.</p>
<p>The more terrifying uncertainty is wanting something but not knowing how to get it. It is working toward something even though there is no sure thing. When we make choices, we open ourselves up to hard work and failure and heartbreak, so sometimes it feels easier not to know, not to choose, and not to do. But it isn&#x2019;t.</p>
<p>The best is the enemy of the good. 
&#x2014;Voltaire, writer/philosopher </p>
<p>If we only wanted to be happy, it would be easy; but we want to be happier than other people, which is almost always difficult, since we think them happier than they are. 
&#x2014;Charles de Montesquieu, writer/philosopher</p>
<p>Some twentysomethings dream too small, not understanding that their twentysomething choices matter and are, in fact, shaping the years ahead. Others dream too big, fueled more by fantasies about limitless possibilities than by experience. Part of realizing our potential is recognizing how our particular gifts and limitations fit with the world around us. We realize where our authentic potential actually lies.</p>
<p>Shoulds can masquerade as high standards or lofty goals, but they are not the same. Goals direct us from the inside, but shoulds are paralyzing judgments from the outside. Goals feel like authentic dreams while shoulds feel like oppressive obligations. Shoulds set up a false dichotomy between either meeting an ideal or being a failure, between perfection or settling.
When I asked about the &#x201C;just&#x201D; in &#x201C;just go home,&#x201D; Talia said she felt like going home would be &#x201C;giving up&#x201D; or &#x201C;taking the easy way out.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This time we talked about what was real, not in terms of unemployment rates and starter jobs, but in terms of what was authentic for Talia. I told her that an adult life is built not out of eating, praying, and loving but out of person, place, and thing: who we are with, where we live, and what we do for a living. We start our lives with whichever of these we know something about.</p>
<p>At a time when many twentysomethings yearn for somewhere to call home and have no idea where they might be in ten years, choosing a place can be incredibly useful. Whether it is moving closer to family or building a life in a city you love, knowing your place is something not to be overlooked.</p>
<p>To accept life in its disjointed pieces is an adult experience of freedom, but still these pieces must lodge and embed themselves somewhere, hopefully in a place that allows them to grow and endure. &#x2014;Richard Sennett, sociologist
A life of infinite possibilities had felt like a disorienting and overwhelming burden, but it had also been a liberating fantasy.</p>
<p>Ian&#x2019;s search for glory was the lure of being different, so he displayed what has been called a common symptom of youth: &#x201C;the dread of doing what has been done before.&#x201D; If he ever chose something to do for work, he didn&#x2019;t want it to be some same-old, everyday thing; his life could be unique.</p>
<p>But self-definition cannot end there. An identity or a career cannot be built around what you don&#x2019;t want. We have to shift from a negative identity, or a sense of what I&#x2019;m not, to a positive one, or a sense of what I am. This takes courage.</p>
<p>A braver form of self-definition dares to be affirmative. Ian needed to move from talking about what he wasn&#x2019;t going to do to talking about what he was going to do.</p>
<p>Ian&#x2019;s life could be personalized and changeable, but it was going to take some time and effort&#x2014;and he would probably need to start with some common parts. Having an uncommon life wasn&#x2019;t going to come from resisting these choices, it was going to come from making these choices. Same as the bike.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joanna: I really love Ian&apos;s case. Maybe because it is some kind similar to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I made the decision to come to D.C., I worried that by making that choice, I was closing all the other doors open to me at that moment. But it was sort of liberating to make a choice about something. Finally. And, if anything, this job has just opened more doors for me. Now I feel really confident that I will have several iterations of my career&#x2014;or at least time for several iterations&#x2014;and that I will be able to do other things in life.</p>
<p>I find myself wanting to go off in an unexpected direction&#x2014;Arabic! Cambodia! I know this is a sort of crazy impulse. I know that the way to live a good life is to pursue things that are not only interesting to you but that make sense.</p>
<h2 id="love">LOVE</h2>
<p>Today&#x2019;s twentysomethings spend more time single than any generation in history. Most will spend years on their own, somewhere between their childhood homes and families of their own. This time gives many people a chance to live it up before they settle down, and to have fun with friends and lovers while the options are open.</p>
<p>The timeline has changed, but a new conversation has not yet begun.</p>
<p>Older spouses may be more mature, but later marriage has its own challenges. Rather than growing together while their twentysomething selves are still forming, partners who marry older may be more set in their ways. And a series of low-commitment, possibly destructive relationships can create bad habits and erode faith in love.</p>
<p>Besides, like with work, good relationships don&#x2019;t just appear when we&#x2019;re ready. It may take a few thoughtful tries before we know what love and commitment really are.</p>
<p>Regardless, the best time to work on Alex&#x2019;s marriage is before she has one.</p>
<p>Dating for me in my twenties was like this musical-chairs thing. Everybody was running around and having fun. Then I hit thirty and it was like the music stopped and everybody started sitting down. I didn&#x2019;t want to be the only one left without a chair. Sometimes I think I married my husband just because he was the closest chair to me at thirty. Sometimes I think I should have just waited for someone who might be a better partner, and maybe I should have, but that seemed risky. What I really wish I&#x2019;d done is thought more about marriage sooner. Like when I was in my twenties.</p>
<p>Friends can do long talks and good cries, but at holiday time or very hard times everyone teamed up with family, and Emma was left standing alone.</p>
<p>Today, we see marriage as a commitment between two individuals. Western culture is generally individualistic, prizing independence and self-fulfillment in almost all areas. We emphasize rights over duties and choice over obligation. This extends especially to marriage. With some notable exceptions, there has never been more freedom to decide whether, when, and how to partner, and with whom.</p>
<p>In psychotherapy, there&#x2019;s a saying that &#x201C;the slower you go, the faster you get there.&#x201D; Sometimes the best way to help people is to slow them down long enough to examine their own thinking.</p>
<p>In a representative nationwide survey, nearly half of twentysomethings agreed with the statement &#x201C;You would only marry someone if he or she agreed to live together with you first, so that you could find out whether you really got along.&#x201D; About two-thirds of twentysomethings believe that moving in together before marriage is a good way to avoid divorce. Jennifer was in this group. She imagined that, unlike her own divorced parents who married young and fast, she would be more successful if she waited to get married and if she lived with her partner first. But couples who &#x201C;live together first&#x201D; are actually less satisfied with their marriages and more likely to divorce than couples who do not. This is what sociologists call the cohabitation effect.</p>
<p>To understand why, it helps to know that the cohabitation effect is technically a pre-engagement cohabitation effect, not a premarital cohabitation effect. Couples who live together before marriage but after becoming engaged, who combine their lives after making a clear and public commitment, are not any more likely to have distressed or dissolved marriages than couples who do not cohabitate before marriage. They do not suffer from the cohabitation effect.</p>
<p>Sliding into cohabitation wouldn&#x2019;t be a problem if sliding out were as easy. It isn&#x2019;t.</p>
<p>Lock-in is the decreased likelihood to search for other options, or change to another option, once an investment in something has been made.</p>
<p>The greater the setup costs, the less likely we are to move to another, even better, situation later. But even a minimal investment can lead to lock-in, especially when we are faced with switching costs. Switching costs&#x2014;or the time, money, or effort it requires to make a change&#x2014;are more complex.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing to cure is the patient&#x2019;s attempt at self-cure.</p>
<p>&#x2018;A raft is a good thing to have when you&#x2019;re crossing a river. But when you get to the other side, put it down.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;For a while, music and sex helped you feel less alone, but now they are making you feel more alone. Every problem was once a solution.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There is a stereotype that psychologists are only interested in childhood memories. Childhood is important, but more and more I am curious about what went on in high school. High school and our twenties are not only the time when we have our most self-defining experiences, study after study shows they are also the time when we have our most self-defining memories.</p>
<p>Personal stories about relationships are much trickier. Without r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;s to organize our experiences with friends and lovers, or interviews that require us to reflect, our most intimate self-defining memories can be pieced together in strange, even painful, ways. Though some of these stories may be left untold, they are no less meaningful or powerful. Research&#x2014;and clinical experience&#x2014;suggest that these untold stories are most often about shame.</p>
<p>The power of these untold personal stories is that, like for Cathy, they can loop silently in our minds without anyone, sometimes even ourselves, knowing about them. The stories are often found hiding, as Cathy said, in the gaps between what we plan to do and what we actually do, or between what happens and what we tell people about what happens.</p>
<p>We sometimes hear that opposites attract, and maybe they do for a hookup. More often, similarity is the essence of compatibility.</p>
<p>deal breakers&#x2014;hobbies, religion, politics, and other similarities that, while convenient, may not actually make us happy.</p>
<p>The Big Five is not about what you like&#x2014;it is about who you are, it is about how you live. The Big Five tells us how you wake up in the morning and how you go about doing most anything. It has to do with how you experience the world and, as a result, how others experience you. This is important because, when it comes to personality, wherever you go, there you are.</p>
<p>Consider that where we are on the Big Five is about 50 percent inherited. This means that you came into this world with roughly half of who you are already in place, because of genes, prenatal influences, and other biological factors. While you learn to interact with the world somewhat differently as experiences make their mark, personality remains relatively stable over time.</p>
<p>Neuroticism, or the tendency to be anxious, stressed, critical, and moody, is far more predictive of relationship unhappiness and dissolution than is personality dissimilarity. While personality similarity can help the years run smoothly, any two people will be different in some way or another. How a person responds to these differences can be more important than the differences themselves. To a person who runs high in Neuroticism, differences are seen in a negative light. Anxiety and judgments about these differences then lead to criticism and contempt, two leading relationship killers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But that&#x2019;s the thing. How do I know if a relationship is hard because it&#x2019;s wrong or because it&#x2019;s real?&#x201D; &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll never know with complete certainty. That&#x2019;s why marriage is a commitment, not a guarantee.&#x201D;</p>
<p>People love those who are like themselves. &#x2014;Aristotle, philosopher </p>
<p>What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility. &#x2014;Leo Tolstoy, writer</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">EPILOGUE</h2>
<p>The best part about being my age is knowing how my life worked out. &#x2014;Scott Adams, cartoonist</p>
<p>There are things that just are what they are. The smartest thing to do is know as much about them as you can.</p>
<p>There is no formula for a good life, and there is no right or wrong life. But there are choices and consequences, so it seems only fair that twentysomethings know about the ones that lie ahead.</p>
<p>The future isn&#x2019;t written in the stars. There are no guarantees. So claim your adulthood. Be intentional. Get to work. Pick your family. Do the math. Make your own certainty. Don&#x2019;t be defined by what you didn&#x2019;t know or didn&#x2019;t do. You are deciding your life right now.</p>
